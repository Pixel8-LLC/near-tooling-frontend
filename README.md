# NEAR Tooling
The goal for NEAR tooling is to create a suite of open source tools that enables builders and users to streamline their experience on NEAR.

The goal is to create a suite of open source tools that you wish existed when started on NEAR. Currently we have:

- Wallet Activity -- A filterable/searchable wallet explorer
- NFT Explorer -- View the NFTs owner by a particular wallet
- NFT Minters -- Get the minters of a contract
- Airdropper (WIP) -- Easily airdrop tokens and NFTs to an array of wallets

These tools are very early in development and could definitely be expanded upon. If you have any ideas for a tool, even if you're not a dev... please open an issue so someone can build it for you.

## Getting Started
`yarn install`

`yarn start`
